# Introduction

Welcome to the FLAMES single sample tutorial!

In this tutorial, we will guide you through a basic analysis of long-read single-cell RNA sequencing data. Our goal is to demonstrate how to use the output from our package, FLAMES, to create and process long-read single-cell data. Here we will focus on using Seurat and other very popular single cell tools for analysis and processing single cell data. Much of this analysis will follow standard short read single cell processing norms, yet with long read data we can also explore isoform-level expression in single cells. This can be very useful as we hope to demonstrate throughout this tutorial.

This tutorial assumes that have;

1.  Run the sc_long_pipeline (to process a single sample) and have set your config file with these parameters set to TRUE

"bambu_isoform_identification": [true] "oarfish_quantification": [true] And

2.  That you have run FLAMES to calculate the ambient RNA profile. An explanation of how to this can be found here: ...

Much of the workflow will remain the same if you decide to use other tools for quantification or isoform discovery, which FLAMES does support, but these are the tools that in our hands perform the best and what we would recommend using at this stage.

This single sample tutorial will use data generated in the Clark lab. This is small dataset of approximately 400 cells. The cells are at Day55 of a excitatory neural differentiation protocol. More information on the dataset and sequencing methodology can be found here ....

## Creating resource files.

To start, we'll create a few essential files that will be used throughout the analysis. The first step is to generate a CSV file containing three key columns: ENSTID, ENSGID, and geneSymbol. This file will be used as a dictionary to rename entries in both the isoform and gene count matrices, replacing ENSGID with the corresponding gene symbol. By adopting this naming convention for ENSTID, we can easily identify the gene origin of each isoform, streamlining the interpretation and analysis of gene and isoform-level data.

First lets define a helper function for this step:

```{r create_gene_symbol_resource, echo = TRUE}
# Function to make csv naming resource 
make_isoform_gene_symbol_dict <- function(FLAMES_gtf, 
                                          reference_gtf, 
                                          output_file) {
  # Import the first GTF file (transcripts GTF)
  gtf1 <- import(FLAMES_gtf)
  gtf1_df <- as.data.frame(gtf1)
  
  # Select relevant columns from the first GTF
  selected_columns1 <- gtf1_df[, c("transcript_id", "gene_id")]
  unique_selected_cols <- unique(selected_columns1)
  
  # Import the second GTF file (reference GTF with gene symbols)
  gtf2 <- import(reference_gtf)
  gtf2_df <- as.data.frame(gtf2)
  
  # Select relevant columns from the second GTF
  selected_columns2 <- gtf2_df[, c("gene_name", "gene_id")]
  unique_gene_symbol <- unique(selected_columns2)
  
  # Merge the two data frames on 'gene_id'
  combined_data <- merge(unique_selected_cols, 
                         unique_gene_symbol, 
                         by = "gene_id", 
                         all.x = TRUE)
  
  # If 'gene_name' is missing, replace it with 'gene_id'
  combined_data$gene_symbol <- ifelse(is.na(combined_data$gene_name), 
                                      combined_data$gene_id, 
                                      combined_data$gene_name)
  
  # Select relevant columns
  final_combined_data <- combined_data[, c("transcript_id", "gene_id", "gene_symbol")]
  
  # Write to a CSV file
  write.csv(final_combined_data, file = output_file, row.names = FALSE)
  
  return(final_combined_data)
}

```

Run this chunk to create the dictionary containing ENSTID, ENSGID, and geneSymbol information:

```{r create_gene_symbol_resource, echo = TRUE}

# The FLAMES ref can be found in your selected output folder after running the Flames pipeline.
flames_gtf_file <- "./data/FLAMES_out/isoform_annotated.gtf.gz"
reference_gtf_file <- "gencode.v47.annotation.gtf.gz"
output_file <- "isoform_gene_dict.csv"

# Call the helper function defined in code block above to create a dictionary containing corresponding gene information for each isoform
isoform_gene_dict <- make_isoform_gene_symbol_dict(flames_gtf_file,
                                                   reference_gtf_file,
                                                   output_file)

```

## Convert count matrices from Gene ID to gene Symbol

With the reference dictionary in place, we can now rename both our count matrix and background count matrix by converting ENSGIDs to geneSymbols. This conversion not only simplifies the interpretation of gene expression in single cells but is also necessary for some downstream tools that require gene symbols instead of ENSGIDs, such as automated cell annotation tools.

Like before, lets define a generic helper function first to do this:

```{r convert_ENSGID_to_geneSymbol, echo = TRUE}
convert_ENSGID_to_geneSymbol <- function(gene_count_matrix_path, 
                                         id_symbol_df = isoform_gene_dict, 
                                         output_file,
                                         return_df = FALSE) {
  
  # Load the reference dictionary we made earlier - select gene-level cols
  id_symbol_df <- id_symbol_df %>%
    dplyr::select(gene_id, gene_symbol)
  
  # Load the data object with ENSGID row names
  gene_count_matrix <- read.csv(gene_count_matrix_path, header = TRUE)
  colnames(gene_count_matrix)[1] <- "gene_id"
  
  # Replace ENSGIDs with gene symbols in original flames gene-level count matrix
  formatted_gene_count_matrix <- gene_count_matrix %>%
    merge(id_symbol_df, by.x = 'gene_id', by.y = 'gene_id') %>%   # Add gene symbol information
    distinct(gene_symbol, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%   # Remove duplicates based on gene symbol
    select(-gene_id) %>%   # Remove the ENSGID column
    column_to_rownames(var = "gene_symbol")   # use the gene symbols we added as rownames
  
  # Write out the processed data frame
  write.csv(formatted_gene_count_matrix, 
            output_file, 
            row.names = TRUE)
  
  # Return the processed count matrix for further use if needed
  if(return_df){
    return(formatted_gene_count_matrix)
  }
}

```

Run the chunk below to format gene-level count matrices for background and FLAMES data using the helper function from above:

```{r convert_ENSGID_to_geneSymbol, echo=TRUE}

# convert Gene_id to gene symbol for gene counts
convert_ENSGID_to_geneSymbol(
  gene_count_matrix_path = "./data/FLAMES_out/gene_count.csv.gz",
  output_file = "geneSymbol_gene_count.csv"
)

# convert Gene_id to gene symbol for background counts
convert_ENSGID_to_geneSymbol(
  gene_count_matrix_path = "./data/background/gene_count.csv.gz",
  output_file = "background_geneSymbol_gene_count.csv"
)

```

Now we have the files we need to begin cleaning our data and removing unwanted noise.

# Session info

```{r sessionInfo, echo=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```
